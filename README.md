# GameofThrones-text-generation-LSTMs
#### The project utilizes LSTMs architecture in the recurrent neural network model to generate/predict/output a 25-word text sequence after inputting a 25-word text sequence. The model is trained using the Game of thrones fictional book in the form of a text file.
## Dataset
#### The dataset used in this project is a desired text segment from the Game of Thrones text file. It selects from indices 0-50000 for computational purposes.
